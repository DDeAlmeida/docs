# NEAR Free Shard Alliance
Quickstart guide

Welcome to GuildNet! This initiative is completely unrelated with NEAR Foundation, and works thanks to the support of the most active node operators from NEAR Protocol community.

In practice, it is an additional network called GuildNet, where the genesis block and the faucets are owned by the community members and not the Foundation.

Why a new network?
1. Stake Wars is oversubscribed, and is difficult to get a seat
2. We want to manage the faucet differently
3. Give an opportunity to validators who are kicked out for insufficient stake on BetaNet
4. See NEAR sharding in action!


## Repos

We are using slightly-customized NEAR tooling, to allow them work on GuildNet:
- [near-shell](https://github.com/near-guildnet/near-shell)
- [near-wallet](https://github.com/near-guildnet/near-wallet)
- [nearcore](https://github.com/near-guildnet/nearcore)
- [nearup](https://github.com/near-guildnet/nearup)
- [near-contract-helper](https://github.com/near-guildnet/near-contract-helper)
- [near-api-js](https://github.com/near-guildnet/near-api-js)

If you plan to run your node (and applications) on GuildNet, keep an eye on these repos!

## Servers

We also have servers running, to provide an easier experience:
- [https://rpc.openshards.io/status](https://rpc.openshards.io/status) to query the state of GuildNet
- [https://wallet.openshards.io/](https://wallet.openshards.io/) to generate and maintain your webwallet
